🎓 I am Vivek Mishra, a aspiring Web Developer. I am Pursuing in masai school for learning web developing.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from cooking, singing, sketching, and touch typing to some whacky ones like writing with my left hand.

📚 I also love reading books on personal development & financial literacy. My favorite ones are The Compound Effect by Darren Hardy in the genre of personal development and Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki in the genre of financial literacy.

✈️ I love traveling too. I have been on school trips to nainital in 2017 and family trips to lahan, city in Nepal in 2019.
